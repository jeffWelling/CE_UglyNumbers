This is my attempt at solving the Ugly Numbers challenge on the CodeEval.com website.

To run it:  

    ./ugly_numbers.rb numbers.txt

numbers.txt is expected to be a list of numbers, one per line.  Running the program will print out a number, one per line, and that number is the total number of expressions for that number sequence that evaluates to an ugly number.
